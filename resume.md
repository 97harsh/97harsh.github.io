## Work Experience

### Software Engineer in Machine Learning, <a href="https://olaelectric.com/" target="_blank">OlaElectric</a> (Electric Two Wheeler Manufacturer)
Feb 2022 - Aug 2022

#### Vehicle Lifecycle Management
##### Predicting Battery Faults
- Designed Attention LSTM-based models to predict battery faults with a recall rate of 80% using past 100km driving data
- The model is comprised of two parts: The first LSTM model focuses on forecasting the time series, the second LSTM focuses on Predicting if the forecasted time series has a fault

##### Data Pipeline Automation for Efficient Complaint Resolution
- Designed and deployed a data pipeline to access all organization data through RESTful APIs, reducing complaint resolution time by **_~5 days_** (40%)
- The Django-based application runs ETL jobs scheduled(using Celery) to fetch new data from identified data sources and puts them into the AWS bucket

##### Real-time Analytics using Apache Spark and Airflow
- Designed and implemented a real-time fault monitoring system for electric scooters using Apache Spark and Airflow.
- The system provided daily fault statistics and trend analysis to stakeholders via custom email templates
- Automated the data collection and presentation process, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.


#### Route Optimization
- Implemented a solution that  would reduce the cost of transportation
for electric bikes by **_∼USD 6M_** per year, a reduction of 30% through the use of mixed integer programming
- Resulted in a reduction of per-electric bike transportation cost by 30% and Turned Around Time(TAT) by 20% from placing an order to fulfilling it

#### Technologies used: Python, Pytorch, Pyspark, Django, PostgreSQL, PowerBI

### Software Engineer in Machine Learning, <a href="https://fractal.ai" target="_blank">Fractal Analytics</a> (Management Consulting)
Jun 2019 - Feb 2022
#### Lead Generation for Relationship managers, Standard Chartered (Multinational Bank)
- Created ETL pipeline using hive to clean and process transactional data used in 3 downstream applications
- Improved write speed into hive tables by 50% by exploiting hive’s properties for the internal module using python 
#### Spot Award: Awarded for going above and beyond for the client

#### Estimating effect of promotions and Baseline Forecasting, Reckitt Benckiser (Consumer Goods Company)
- Created and Deployed an Elasticnet-based regression model that accurately forecasts retail sales and reduces run time by **_20 hours_**; a reduction of 80% compared to earlier deployment
- Success of the solution lead to winning contracts for 7 more markets
#### Star Award: Awarded for out of the box thinking and innovation in deploying solutions


#### Baseline Forecasting in Covid, Reckitt Benckiser (Consumer Goods Company)
- Built a new pipeline with a three-person team to forecast baseline sales for all retail stores in a market near the COVID period 
- Created novel features based on covid geographic data which helped the model forecast good results even in unstable Covid markets
- The created model performed <15% MAPE on unseen near-future forecasts


#### Entity Mapping, Standard Chartered (Multinational Bank)
- Developed entity recognition model using a combination of GloVe embeddings and expectation maximization
- Enriched the Embeddings using alternate names extracted from news data and by matching child entities.
- Achieved a 90% match score on all client names within the organization 

#### Feedback Capturing, Standard Chartered (Multinational Bank)
- Designed and implemented scalable feedback capturing and processing mechanism for Signals generated, which was extended to 16 use cases


#### Technologies used: Python, Pyspark, Tensorflow, Hadoop, PowerBI
