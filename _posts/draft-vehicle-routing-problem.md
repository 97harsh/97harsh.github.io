## Vehicle Routing Problem

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known problem in operations research and logistics, which deals with optimizing the delivery of goods or services by a fleet of vehicles. A combinatorial optimization problem involves finding the best routes and schedules for vehicles. It must serve a given group of customers while minimizing the total travel distance, time, or other cost metrics.

When solving for the VRP, each customer has a demand that must be satisfied by one of the vehicles, and each vehicle has a limited capacity. The objective is to find a set of routes that meet all the customer demands while minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles. Or in the least amount of time or consuming the least fuel. Google maps route, for example, is a Vehicle Routing problem. Another example could be an ordering from Domino's; the delivery partner carries multiple pizza boxes for customers from a region of the city. What is the best way for her to deliver the fastest or with the least fuel spent?

The VRP can be formulated as a mathematical optimization problem, and various algorithms and techniques can be used to solve it. Some common approaches include exact methods, such as integer programming and branch-and-cut algorithms, and heuristic methods, such as metaheuristics, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing.

The VRP has many other practical applications, including logistics, transportation, and delivery services. By solving the VRP, companies can improve their efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better customer service.

This blog will discuss specific about a particular problem which is called Pickup and Delivery Problem(PDP)

Consider a courier company that needs to deliver packages to different customers located in a city using a fleet of vehicles. Each package needs to be picked up from a specific location and delivered to a different location. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the vehicles while satisfying all the delivery requirements.

### PDP Formulation:
To model PDP mathematically, we can use VRP formulation. Let's assume we have N customers, each with a pickup location and a delivery location. We can represent the problem as a graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges. The nodes represent the pickup and delivery locations, and the edges represent the distance between them.

We can formulate the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with the following constraints:

1. Each customer must be visited exactly once by a vehicle.
2. The total capacity of the vehicle cannot exceed its maximum capacity.
3. The vehicle cannot travel more than its maximum distance limit.
4. A delivery can only be made after the corresponding pickup.
5. The objective function is to minimize the total distance traveled by vehicles.

#### PDP Variants:
There are two variants of PDP:
1. Single-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem (SPDP): In this variant, only one vehicle is used to deliver all the packages. The problem is to find the optimal route for the vehicle to visit all the customers and deliver their packages.

2. Multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem (MPDP): In this variant, multiple vehicles are used to deliver the packages. The problem is to assign the packages to the vehicles and find the optimal route for each vehicle to visit the assigned customers and deliver their packages.

#### PDP is an NP-hard problem, it is challenging to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time

#### Exact solutions
Exact algorithms are methods that guarantee finding the optimal solution to a combinatorial optimization problem, including the Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP). These algorithms work by exploring the entire solution space, which can be computationally expensive, but they can provide the optimal solution for small and medium-sized instances of the problem.

We'll Discuss 3 exact solution methods, although there are other exact solutions too

##### Branch and bound problem
Branch and Bound is a systematic algorithm that explores the solution space by branching on decision variables and pruning infeasible subproblems. At each node, the algorithm evaluates a lower bound on the objective function value and prunes the node if the lower bound is worse than the current best solution. The algorithm continues to branch and prune until it finds the optimal solution.

Advantages:

1. Guaranteed optimality: Branch and Bound is an exact algorithm, which means it can find the optimal solution to a combinatorial optimization problem if given enough time and resources.

2. Flexibility: Branch and Bound can handle various types of constraints and objective functions.

3. Heuristic pruning: Branch and Bound can use heuristics to prune subproblems that are unlikely to lead to the optimal solution, which can significantly reduce the search space.

Disadvantages:

1. Computational complexity: Branch and Bound explores the entire solution space, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large problem instances.

2. Memory requirements: Branch and Bound requires significant memory resources to store the search tree and the lower and upper bounds of each node.

3. Inefficiency for some problems: Branch and Bound may not be efficient for some problems with complex constraints or objective functions that are difficult to linearize.

When to use Branch and Bound:

1. When optimality is critical: Branch and Bound is a suitable method when the optimal solution is essential, and approximation methods cannot provide an acceptable solution.

2. When the problem size is small to medium: Branch and Bound is more suitable for small to medium-sized instances of the problem, where the search space is manageable.

3. When the problem has a simple structure: Branch and Bound is more efficient for problems with simple constraints and objective functions that can be easily linearized.

4. When the problem has a branching structure: Branch and Bound is a version of Solver which can be used for a lot of optimization problems, but it is more efficient for problems with a natural branching structure, such as graph problems.

In summary, Branch and Bound is a powerful exact algorithm that can provide the optimal solution to combinatorial optimization problems such as the Pickup and Delivery Problem. However, it has some disadvantages, such as computational complexity and memory requirements. One should use Branch and Bound when the optimal solution is critical, the problem size is small to medium, the problem has a simple structure, and the problem has a natural branching structure. For larger problems or problems with complex constraints or objective functions, approximation methods or metaheuristics may be more appropriate.
