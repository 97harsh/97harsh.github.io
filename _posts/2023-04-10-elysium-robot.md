This research paper discusses a new method to improve the capabilities of tiny, electrically powered motors (called micro- and nanomotors) that are used for studying individual cells in a laboratory setting. These motors can trap, move, and manipulate single cells using a special particle called a Janus particle [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_particles) (JP) and an electric field.

One of the challenges in using these tiny motors is that they don't work well in solutions with higher conductivity (how well a substance can conduct electricity), especially in conditions that mimic the natural environment of cells. The researchers found a solution to this problem by combining magnetic field-based propulsion with electric field-based manipulation. This allows the motors to function better in conductive solutions close to the natural environment of cells.

By adjusting the electric field frequency, the researchers were able to improve the mobility and steering control of these tiny motors. They also demonstrated that the motors could differentiate between different types of cells, such as healthy, dying, and dead cells, based on how they respond to the electric field. This is useful for studying the effects of drugs and therapies on individual cells.

The researchers also showed that the motors could trap and transport live cells towards regions containing drug-loaded particles, which could have potential applications in drug delivery and single-cell analysis. Overall, this new approach using hybrid micromotors offers exciting possibilities for studying cells in conditions that closely resemble their natural environment.
