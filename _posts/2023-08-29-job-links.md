title: Staying on Top of the Job Hunt with a Serverless Job Listings Tracker
description: As a new grad, I wanted to share some current data science and machine learning job opportunities that may be of interest to others in their search. In this post, I provide a dynamically updated spreadsheet populated by my customized job finder built on AWS Lambda. The tracker scrapes listings from multiple sites and collates relevant openings tailored to skills that new graduates likely possess. By automating the search and centralizing the results, I'm able to maintain this frequently refreshed board listings. Whether you're looking to apply or just exploring openings, feel free to browse opportunities and bookmark for future reference. I briefly cover the serverless implementation that powers this continuous discovery. My goal is paying it forward by helping fellow new grads kickstart their job hunt.

Since I am graduating this semester I asked myself, what is the best way to find jobs and also create a project to showcase my skills to hack at different tools and make them work


I have configured a series of Lambda Functions on AWS to search for Data Science and Machine Learning Focused jobs

Below is the sheet where new jobs are updated every few hours:
